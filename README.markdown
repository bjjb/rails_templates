JJ's Ruby on Rails Application Templates
========================================

Some very bog standard Ruby on Rails Rails application templates, suitable for
use with Rails 2.3.2 and greater.

Right now the [basic_template.rb][] (almost a direct clone of Ryan Bates's
[Railscasts][] [episode][] template) is sufficient.

As he said, you can always use it directly with

> `rails myapp -m http://github.com/jjbuckley/rails_templates/raw/master/basic_template.rb`

[basic_template.rb]: http://github.com/jjbuckley/rails_templates/raw/master/basic_template.rb
